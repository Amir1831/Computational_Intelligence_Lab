# Least square , Ridge regression , Overfitting

our goal in this section :
* How to implement `Least Square ` with regression ?
* What is overfit ?
* How to implement `Ridge Regression` ?

## Least square
First we implement `Least square ` Function.
Then we compare the **(w0,w1)** that Least Square generate with the weights that we found with `Grid search` . 
## Build Poly-nomial Features

By using `Polynomial Features` we can predict non-linear data.

so we make polynomial features and use our Least Square Function to find weighta for these features. 

## Ridge regression
In the last step we implement `Ridge regression`.
